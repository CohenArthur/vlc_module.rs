# Helper library to write VLC modules in Rust

This work was extracted from https://github.com/Geal/rust-vlc-demux to provide general tools to make VLC modules in Rust.

It provides some of the struct definitions, some of the functions exported by libVLCCore, and macros to declare a module and call `vlc_Log`.
